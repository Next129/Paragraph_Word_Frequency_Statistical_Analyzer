Iterative text acquisition defines the process, reading input line by line. When the token “END” or “end” appears, collection halts. Other tokens are case-folded and stripped of trailing punctuation before aggregation. A second phase counts token occurrences and classifies them into ranges 1–2, 3–4, and above 4.
